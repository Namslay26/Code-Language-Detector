# Code-Language-Detector
A glove that recognizes hand gestures and outputs the code language.

## Problem Statement 
* Around 500,000 people in the US and Canada alone use Sign Language.
* But unfortunately, there is not much awareness about the language and most people are unable to comprehend sign language, let alone reply back in the same.
* Communication is an integral part of survival. Thus, we believe that we must equip people with the right tools to do so.

## Our Solution 
* We have made a glove using the hardware listed in the below section and used the readings of the finger movements to map to the appropriate sign language character.
* At the moment, the scope of our project is limited to: ASL Digits and Numbers.

## Requirements 
* Arduino IDE
* Arduino Nano R3
* HC-05 Bluetooth Module 
* SpectraSymbol Bend Sensor
* Adafruit Analog Accelerometer: ADXL335
* Resistor

## Installation 
* Use the following command to clone the repository onto your system.
```
  git clone https://github.com/Namslay26/Code-Language-Detector.git
```
* To run your installation,
* * Connect to the necessary hardware,
  * Open the code through Arduino IDE,
  * Compile and run the code.
  * Check Serial Monitor for the results.
